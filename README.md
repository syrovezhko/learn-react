So, a few words about memory. I didn't quit studying. I just found an internship as a Front End Developer. It's free, but I have a stake in that startup. It's enshrined verbally, but that doesn't matter. A mentoring on me and participation in team working are worth more than all the money in the world for me.  
> p.s.: I can say that it's my second month of commercial experience absolutely legally, after all I've made a first pull request to main branch on December 27th, 2022 (changed DB user name in readmeüòÅ).

Well, my last task turned out to be more complicated for entry level and teamleed could not help in it. While he tries to understand how to solve the problem I've got a night for keep learning.

That's enough for today, I guess.
