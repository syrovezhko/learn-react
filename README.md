> This day is the last of the New Year holidays. You can envy Russians if you are not. Every winter we have got a vacation of 10 days or so. But I just keep coding in bed with a cold.

## CallBack from the ***form*** component to ***App***
I started the UI yesterday. Today I will begin with the decomposition.  
I have to make a `PostForm.jsx` in the `component`'s folder and past there the `form` from the `App.js` as a `root` tag. The state should be moved also. 
> Don't forget to add `PostForm` to the `App.js`!

Now, it's time to talk about the data exchanged between components.  
We've already used props but haven't discussed it. There are some properties/arguments/parameters that components could take from outside. 
However, the exchange can be from parent to children only.

It worked yesterday. But today, if the PostForm component have to create a new post, it should  transmit that up to App.js, which is the parent, to add that to the posts array. And so, that is impossible. Still, I can add a [callback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) function to `App` that will `wait` the post and than will `push` it to the `array`. To provide this, all I need is to `call` the function `from` the `child`.

Well, I can move `addNewPost` function to `PostForm` component. I have not access to `setPost` state. I'll swap it to a `newPost` which should contain the same object inside.

<details><summary>Now, <b><i>App.js</i></b> and <b><i>PostForm.jsx</i></b> look like this ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ</summary>
<table align="center">

    <th>App.js</th>
    <th>PostForm.jsx</th>

    {id: 3, title: 'The third title', body: 'description'},

  // the callBack function
  const createPost = (newPost) => {
    // array update

That's enough for today, I guess.
